          <h4>ABOUT KEEPING COMMUNITY CLEAN</h4>
          <p>
            should be explained to the community There are multiple facets of
            waste management that all come with hazards, both for those around
            the disposal site and those who work within waste management.
            Exposure to waste of any kind can be detrimental to the health of
            the individualprimary conditions that worsen with exposure to waste
            are asthma and tuberculosis.[42] The exposure to waste on an average
            individual is highly dependent on the conditions around them, those
            in less developed or lower income areas are more susceptible to the
            effects of waste product, especially though chemical waste.[43] The
            range of hazards due to waste is extremely large and covers every
            type of waste, not only chemical. There are many different
            guidelines to follow for disposing different types of waste
            chemical, municipal, organic, biomedical, and radioactive wastes. In
            some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health.[2] Health
            issues are associated with the entire process of waste management.
            Health issues can also arise indirectly or directly: directly
            through the handling of solid waste, and indirectly through the
            consumption of water, soil, and food.[2] Waste is produced by human
            activity, for example, the extraction and processing of raw
            materials.[3] Waste management is intended to reduce the adverse
            effects of waste on human health, the environment, planetary
            resources, and aesthetics. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur

          <p>
            Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and
            actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final
            disposal.[1] This includes the collection, transport, treatment, and
            disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the
            waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, and
            economic mechanisms. Waste can either be solid, liquid, or gases and
            each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste
            management deals with all types of waste, including industrial,

          <p>
            Effective waste management practices are vital for several reasons.
            First, they minimize the pollution of air, water, and soil that can
            result from improper waste disposal. For example, open landfills can
            contaminate drinking water sources and spread diseases. Second,
            waste management practices can help recover valuable resources
            through recycling and composting, reducing the need to extract new
            raw materials. Third, reducing waste and promoting recycling creates
            jobs in the waste management sector and related industries. Finally,
            effective waste management contributes to a circular economy, where
            resources are reused and recycled, minimizing environmental impact
            and maximizing resource efficiency

          <h4>COMMUNITY CLEANUP</h4>
          <p>
            Waste management encompasses the processes of collecting, treating,
            and disposing of materials discarded as useless or unwanted. It is
            crucial for minimizing the negative impacts of human activities on
            the environment and public health. Effective waste management
            involves reducing waste generation, promoting reuse and recycling,
            and responsibly disposing of what remains, often through landfilling
            or incineration. Proper waste management is essential for building
            sustainable and healthy communities.
